# Weatherly

Weatherly is a weather app built with simplicity in mind. It is a quick way to get a detailed forecast of current conditions as well as the a forecast summary and severe weather alerts.

Weatherly was built using the DarkySky API and Geocode API. User inputs are broken down into numerical longitutde and latitude values in the Geocode API which are then fed to the DarkSky query to return usable JSON data. That data is displayed to the user in the created weather card.

### To Use
Simply enter the location you would like to search for and click search!

### To Run locally
You must obtain your own DarkSky and Geocode API keys as the keys for this app are hidden as environmental variables.
